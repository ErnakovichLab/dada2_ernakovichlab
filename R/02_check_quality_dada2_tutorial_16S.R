#' ### 1. FILTER AND TRIM FOR QUALITY
#' 
#' Before chosing sequence variants, we want to trim reads where their quality scores begin to drop (the `truncLen` and `truncQ` values) and remove any low-quality reads that are left over after we have finished trimming (the `maxEE` value).
#' 
#' **You will want to change this depending on run chemistry and quality:** For 2x250 bp runs you can try ```truncLen=c(240,160)``` (as per the [dada2 tutorial](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html#inspect-read-quality-profiles)) if your reverse reads drop off in quality. Or you may want to choose a higher value, for example, ```truncLen=c(240,200)```, if they do not. In ```truncLen=c(xxx,yyy)```, ```xxx``` refers to the forward read truncation length, ```yyy``` refers to the reverse read truncation length.
#' 
#' **For ITS data:** Due to the expected variable read lengths in ITS data you should run this command without the ```trunclen``` parameter. See here for more information and appropriate parameters for ITS data: [https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ITS_workflow.html](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ITS_workflow.html).
#' 
#' *From dada2 tutorial:*
#' >If there is only one part of any amplicon bioinformatics workflow on which you spend time considering the parameters, it should be filtering! The parameters ... are not set in stone, and should be changed if they donâ€™t work for your data. If too few reads are passing the filter, increase maxEE and/or reduce truncQ. If quality drops sharply at the end of your reads, reduce truncLen. If your reads are high quality and you want to reduce computation time in the sample inference step, reduce  maxEE. 
#' 
#' #### Inspect read quality profiles
#' It's important to get a feel for the quality of the data that we are using. To do this, we will plot the quality of some of the samples.
#' 
#' *From the dada2 tutorial:*
#' >In gray-scale is a heat map of the frequency of each quality score at each base position. The median quality score at each position is shown by the green line, and the quartiles of the quality score distribution by the orange lines. The red line shows the scaled proportion of reads that extend to at least that position (this is more useful for other sequencing technologies, as Illumina reads are typically all the same length, hence the flat red line).

  fwd_qual_plots <- plotQualityProfile(paste0(subF.fp, "/", fastqFs))

} else {
  rand_samples <- sample(size = 20, 1:length(fastqFs)) # grab 20 random samples to plot
  writeLines(paste0("Samples being plotted are \n", paste(sort(fastqFs[rand_samples]), collapse = ", ")))
  fwd_qual_plots <- plotQualityProfile(paste0(subF.fp, "/", fastqFs[rand_samples]))
